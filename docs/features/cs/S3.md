# S3

[S3 class implementation](/features/cs/S3.cs)

Before you use this class i recommend you to use an interface and inject it on your dependencies with your dependency injection system.

If you wanna an example of interface you can get:

```cs
public interface ICloudStorage
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Upload a new file to the cloud storage
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="file">File to be uploaded</param>
    /// <param name="folder">Folder where the file should be</param>
    /// <returns>file location path</returns>
    public Task<string> UploadFileAsync(IFormFile file, string? folder = null);

    /// <summary>
    /// delete a file that is on cloud storage by your path
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="fullpath">path from root until the file</param>
    /// <returns></returns>
    public Task DeleteFileAsync(string fullpath);
}
```

and inject in your dependencies like in .NET CORE 7

```cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddSingleton<ICloudStorage, S3>();
```

### Setting up the AWS credentials

Make sure you have your [AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/net-dg-config-netcore.html) configured in your machine.

Now, add your settings to the `appsettings.Development.json` like:

```json
{
  "AWS_S3": {
    "Profile": "default",
    "Region": "us-east-2"
  }
}
```

the `Profile` and `Region` should be your bucket `Profile` and `Region`.

Then, let's install the needed packages:

installing the `AWSSDK.S3`

```shell
dotnet add package AWSSDK.S3
```

installing the `AWSSDK.Extensions.NETCore.Setup` to setup dependency injection

```shell
dotnet add package AWSSDK.Extensions.NETCore.Setup
```

now, let's inject the necessary stuff to work with s3:

```cs
builder.Services.AddAWSService<IAmazonS3>();
```

and set the default aws credentials:

```cs
var awsOptions = builder.Configuration.GetAWSOptions("AWS_S3");

services.AddDefaultAWSOptions(awsOptions);
```

and, done.

in any of your controllers (for example) you can add the `ICloudStorage` interface as parameter type, and you should have access to the methods successfully
